Wallaby::View is a Ruby gem that extends Rails layout/template/partial inheritance chain to allow searching layout/template/partial using action name and theme name.

## Install

Add Wallaby::View to `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem 'wallaby-view'
```

And re-bundle.

```shell
bundle install
```

Include Wallaby::View in ApplicationController:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Wallaby::View
end
```

## What It Does

For example, given the following controllers:

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Wallaby::View
end

# app/controllers/admin/application_controller
class Admin::ApplicationController < ApplicationController
  self.theme_name = 'secure'
end

# app/controllers/admin/users_controller
class Admin::UsersController < Admin::ApplicationController
  self.theme_name = 'account'
  self.options = { mapping_actions: { edit: 'form' } }
end
```

By using Wallaby::View, the lookup folder order of `admin/application#edit` action becomes:

- app/views/admin/application/edit
- app/views/admin/application
- app/views/secure/edit
- app/views/secure
- app/views/application/edit
- app/views/application

Then it is possible to create a relative partial in one of the above folder for `admin/application#edit` action, for instance:

```erb
<%# app/views/admin/application/edit.html.erb %>
<% render 'form' %>

<%# app/views/secure/edit/_form.html.erb %>
This form partial is for edit action and theme secure,
but can be rendered by admin/application#edit action
```

For `admin/users#edit` action, because `mapping_actions` is set, `edit` is mapped to `form`.
Therefore, the lookup folder order of `admin/users#edit` becomes:

- app/views/admin/users/form
- app/views/admin/users
- app/views/secure/form
- app/views/secure
- app/views/admin/application/form
- app/views/admin/application
- app/views/secure/form
- app/views/secure
- app/views/application/form
- app/views/application
